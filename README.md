# Basic Portfolio

Collection of my best work!

## Bootstrap Grid and Sticky Footer

### Features
- Adding a Navbar
- A responsive layout
- Responsive images
- Bootstrap's Grid system
- Sticky Footer


With utilizing Bootstrap's layout in my HTML I have been able to add a Navbar hidden within the header of my Portfolio. If you hover over the menu button you will see a dropdown menu with the following links: About Me, Contact Me, and Portfolio. 

Adding the Bootstrap Grid system I have reorganized my portfolio page for better spacing between pictures. All rows are based on a 2 column Grid.

If you are check the site on a smaller screen you'll see that the layout has become responsive, moving around the pictures and other content to better fit all types.

I have also deployed a sticky footer at the bottom of all pages to show copyright at all times.
