## Bootstrap Grid and Sticky Footer

### Features
- Bootstrap Navbar
- A responsive layout
- Responsive images
- Bootstrap's Grid system
- Sticky Footer
- Onclick event listener added to divs on the portfolio page.   
- Links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
- Resume page



With utilizing Bootstrap's layout in my HTML I have been able to add a Navbar hidden within the header of my Portfolio. If you hover over the menu button you will see a dropdown menu with the following links: About Me, Contact Me, Portfolio, Resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub. 

Adding the Bootstrap Grid system I have reorganized my portfolio page for better spacing between pictures. All rows are based on a 2 column Grid.

If you are check the site on a smaller screen you'll see that the layout has become responsive, moving around the pictures and other content to better fit all types.

I have also deployed a sticky footer at the bottom of all pages to show copyright at all times.

By implementing an onclick within the divs on the portfolio page, a user can "click" on the imgs and it will direct them to the appropriate site.
